# Student Information System

A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data. Student Information Systems (often abbreviated as SIS systems) provide capabilities for registering students on courses, documenting grading transcripts and results of student test and other assessment scores, build student schedules, track student attendance, and manage many other student-related data needs in a school. A SIS should not be confused with a learning management system or virtual learning environment, where course materials, assignments and assessment tests can be published electronically.
